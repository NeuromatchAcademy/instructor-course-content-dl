# Using jupyterbook

While you can see videos and the notebooks in this jupyterbook, you have to launch each page in an interactive environment in order to write or run code.

**Important:** In the jupyterbook, some videos are not shown. Please, open the notebook in google colab or in kaggle and execute the respective cells. You may need to run also the *Setup* cells. If you spot anything unusual, please file an issue.
